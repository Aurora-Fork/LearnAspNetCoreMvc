# Learn ASP.NET Core MVC - Sample Application
**by Jess Chadwick**

This is the sample application for the Lynda.com online video training course, Learn ASP.NET Core MVC.

Here you'll be able to explore the completed code for the application built throughout course. 
If you are looking for the state of the application at a certain video in the course, you'll want to visit the [main respository](https://github.com/jchadwick/LearnAspNetCoreMvc).

NOTE: this respository **does not include the graphical assets** for the course.  If you really want to see the pretty pictures just like in the videos, you'll need to download them from the course website found in the link above.
